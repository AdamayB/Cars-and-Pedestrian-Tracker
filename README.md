# Cars-and-Pedestrian-Tracker

**Language Used**: Python 

**Modules**: 1)OpenCV
                        2)numpy

Track and differentiate between a **CAR** and a **PEDESTRIAN** using OpenCV in an mp4 file.


This app tries to mimic a TESLA Cars feature, which helps it to drive itself. It uses a car detector algo which already existed on the internet. 

This app is a robust version of the Tesla feauture that it tries to mimic. This app is not 100% accurate.

This app will be improved and refined in the near future as I gain more knowledge.
